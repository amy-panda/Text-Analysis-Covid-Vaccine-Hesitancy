# Text Analysis for Covid-19 Vaccine Hesitancy
This notebook explores and analyses the text dataset of people's intent expressions around COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and brings insight into people's main concerns about COVID-19 vaccines. The recommendations are given to help public health officials to develop targeted communication and education strategies that address concerns and promote vaccine acceptance.


## üí° Interesting Findings






## üìù Recommendations

Based on the findings, a few suggestions are provided to the public health officials or the government as below:

- Be transparent about the side effects of different vaccines (such as third shot, booster shot) and how they impact different groups (such as children, women etc.);
- Provide learning resouces online or in the community to help people gain a better understanding of vaccines and things relevant to vaccines, for example how long the vaccine is effective, what are the safety measures after vaccination, what are the differences between different type of shot and so on;
- Build stronger trust between the public and the government by reporting the side effects of vaccines with integrity, enhancing the regulations and inspection on the quality of vaccines and other effective measures to rebuild the trust and improve the vaccine acceptance.
